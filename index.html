            <p>I am a prospective full-stack developer with a bachelor’s degree in computer science, 
              who has worked with a large array of different coding languages. I have experience working 
              with java, python, android studio, javascript, and a few other coding languages. \n I really
               love the creation aspect of coding, where the smaller pieces are assembled and eventually
              come together to make a larger working product. I’m really good at picking apart the smaller
               to pieces to find issues and figure out what is mechanically not working. \n I have great
              communication skills, an open-mind, and the determination to finish what I’ve started. Using
               these skills, I hope to be able to build great and meaningful applications in the future.
